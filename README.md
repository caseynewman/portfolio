# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was built to help showcase 


This project was built to help ensure accessibility for Horiseon's website by utilizing semantic HTML, alt attributes, and allowing the elements to follow a logical structure. The intention is that upon reading the code, users and screenreaders will have a clear understanding of the site and what the company offers. This project helps make the site accessible for anyone using assistive technology, and ultimately ensures the site is optimized for search engines. In performing this audit, I learned the importance of alt text, how to use semantic HTML, and best practices for structuring a site in a logical way.

# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was built to showcase my work as a web developer so that potential employers can clearly see my skills and what I have to offer. My intention was to focus on functionality and accessibility within a clean, minimalist design. In creating this portfolio, I learned how to build a website from scratch by utilizing semantic HTML. I learned how to schowcase my work within flexboxes, how to create a flexbox within a flexbox, and how to make my site responsive with media queries. I also learned how to use relative and absolute positioning to place titles over my application images.

# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio was built to showcase my work as a web developer so that potential employers can clearly see my skills and what I have to offer. My intention was to focus on functionality and accessibility within a clean, minimalist design. In creating this portfolio, I learned how to build a website from scratch by utilizing semantic HTML. I learned how to schowcase my work within flexboxes, how to use flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis, and how to make my site responsive with media queries. I also learned how to use relative and absolute positioning to place titles over my application images.

## Credits

My tutor, John Titus, helped me rework the 'Work' section of my portfolio, utilizing flex to make the first application larger and the entire element responsive.
